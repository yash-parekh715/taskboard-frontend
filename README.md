# 📊 Task Management Collaboration Platform - Creative Upaay Internship Challenge

**Comprehensive task management system** developed for the **Creative Upaay Web Development Internship Assessment**. This solution offers a collaborative workspace where teams can organize tasks, track events, and manage subtasks with live updates, deadline notifications, and intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.

## 💫 Solution Highlights

The platform enables users to:

- **Create**, **remove**, and **modify** events, tasks, and subtasks
- Transition tasks between **To Do**, **On Progress**, and **Done** states using **drag-and-drop**
- Receive alerts for tasks that are **past deadline** or **approaching due dates**
- Experience **live updates** through **WebSocket technology**
- Benefit from persistent application state via **Redux and LocalStorage**
- Access securely with **JWT authentication**

> ✨ Successfully delivered all **Level 1** requirements plus **5 out of 7 Level 2 optional features** as specified in the assignment brief.

> ⚠️ Performance Notice
> Free-tier hosting services (Vercel and Render) may introduce latency and cold-start delays that affect the application's responsiveness.
> For optimal performance evaluation, running the application locally is recommended by following the instructions below.

### 1. Clone the backend Repository - run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-parekh715/taskboard-backend.git
cd taskboard-backend
npm install
```

create a .env file with the variables

- DATABASE_URL - url of the online/local postgres data base you want to use.
- JWT_SECRET - secret key value

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_migration
npm run start
```

### 2. Clone the frontend Repository - run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yash-parekh715/taskboard-frontend.git
cd taskboard-frontend
npm install
```

create a .env file with the variables

- VITE_API_AUTH_URL - url for where your backend is hosted / listening for login, signup requests.
- VITE_SOCKET_URL - url for where your socket interacts.

```bash
npm run dev
```
